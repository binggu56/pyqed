# Diffusion Monte Carlo 
- To use dmc.py,change the dimensionality of the system (DIM) and corresponding potential energy (V)    

# Variational Monte Carlo

# Path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) 
- Map quantum mechanical system to a ring-polymer classical system  and use Monte Carlo to sovle the classical ensemble
