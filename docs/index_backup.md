Main modules
==========================

Nonlinear molecular spectroscopy
====

* sum-of-states for multilevel system 

* correlation function approach (for open quantum systems)

Direct computing the many-point correlation functions with the quantum regression theorem 

* non-perturbative approah 

Simulating the laser-driven dynamics including explicitly all laser pulses. 
This approach can be used for all systems provided the dynamics can be solved. 




Molecular quantum dynamics 
=============

- Wavepacket dynamics in a single potential energy surface

- Split-operator method 
For the exact nonadiabatic dynamics of vibronic models in the diabatic representation.
