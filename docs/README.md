# Welcome to LIght-Matter Everything!

The ultimate goal is to provide a simple-to-use package to study how light interacts with matter.  

Check manual.pdf for documentation! 

Main modules

# Nonlinear molecular spectroscopy 
* sum-of-states for multilevel system

Pros: computationally cheap 
Cons: decay is introduced phenomelogically; pure dephasing cannot be addressed 

* correlation function approach --  Direct computing the many-point correlation functions with the quantum regression theorem 


Valid for open quantum systems where environment effects can be rigirously described with open quantum system techniques. 

Visulize with double-sided Feynman diagrams instead of the time-loop diagrams. 


* non-perturbative approah -- valid for ALL systems provided the quantum dynamics can be compuated 

Simulating the laser-driven dynamics including explicitly all laser pulses
